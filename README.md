# Lucky seven
## T7E Casino Game

This project was created for the Encode Solidity Bootcamp as the final project. The T7E Casino Game allows players to flip a coin and potentially win ETH. To play the game, users must first purchase T7E (Team 7 Early) ERC20 tokens using ETH.

The backend of the game is implemented as a smart contract, which can be found in a [separate repository](https://github.com/78carla/casino-dapp-blockend). The smart contract has been deployed on the Mumbai Testnet. The frontend is built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Three.js. Rainbow-Kit is used for the wallet functionality, and ethers.js is used to connect to the smart contract.
